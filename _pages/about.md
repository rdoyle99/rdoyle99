## Hi, I'm Ryan Doyle
Here's my [💻 Github 💻](https://github.com/rdoyle99) and my [⚡ Twitter ⚡](https://twitter.com/Ryan___Doyle)

I quit my tech sales job on 7/31/2020 to work on my own SaaS projects full-time - it's always been a dream of mine.

I like to build small companies and have been doing so (semi-successfully) since college. I've self-taught coding over the last few years and have spent my whole life inventing and building.

I'm from the Finger Lakes of New York, and grew up on a farm there. It's where I was taught about the reward of hard work and where I'm building from for now.
