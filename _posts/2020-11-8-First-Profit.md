Hit my first profit this week. It was a doozy. Between speaking at [Jack Butcher's office hours](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1324455808709627908) and launching SalesAdvice.io(https://SalesAdvice.io), I stayed busy.

For the first time traffic was COMING to me, instead of me chasing it. I posted my first revenue: **$77 MRR.** Some of that is from [Chatty](https://trychatty.com/) (which I'm still planning on shutting down), some is from [SalesAdvice.io](https://salesadvice.io/) (which got 30 new subscribers after the Jack Butcher event).

Now I'm focusing on growing SalesAdvice.io, to capitalize on the love I got from the Butcher event, and from offering Free Sales Advice Fridays for months. I want it to be **the** bootstrapper's guidebook on sales tactics that anybody can emulate. It's clearly something people have wanted from me, and I hope to grow it into so much more than a weekly newsletter.

This week, I'm sending out Report #0003 via email. Topic: my cold email that gets a 40% reply rate, and how anyone can emulate it for free. Then, I'm compiling every Free Sales Advice Friday consultation into a repository for subscribers. Soon, I'd like to do monthly lead drops to give my community a leg up.

There's a lot of excitement in this project because there's so much optionality. And my subscribers get to drive it. **There are 8 spots left to get 50% off for life. If you use the code FIRST10 at [Checkout](https://gum.co/DyZff),** I'd love for you to be part of this journey.
