> It's nervewracking. I can see all the gaps and bugs. I see bugs that I know other people will see. But I have to ship V1 at some point to get that crucial customer feedback and, you know, money. Because a business isn't > a business without revenue.

\*A quote from one of my [first posts](https://ryanpdoyle.com/2020/09/26/early-weeks) on building software.

A year ago, I quit my sales job, moved home, and started building software that I wish I would have had in my sales career. I'm not at \$10k MRR (yet) but here's what I do have:

- Financial Backing from [Calm Fund](https://calmfund.com/)
- 2,500 users on [Magic Sales Bot](https://www.magicsalesbot.com/) with more coming in every day
- Mentors and a community that help me build
- A cool house in Costa Rica that I'm going to build from for the next couple months
- The ability to code and develop product that I could have only dreamed about a year ago

Magic Sales Bot has been my everything for 7 months, after stumbling through a few product ideas and failing in my initial boostrapper months. Failed products include:

- Chatty, a wrapper for sales content that lets you message viewers from Slack
- SalesAdvice, a paid newsletter that imparts professional sales know-how to bootstrappers
- Sales & Startups, a job board tailored to salespeople
- GetEncore, a way of getting alerted if your customers have moved jobs, for companies with 50k+ customers

I'm full-in on Magic Sales Bot because people want a solution to their cold email woes, as evidenced by my daily signup rate.

## Why hasn't Magic Sales Bot taken off yet?

You might see 2,500 users and \$900 MRR and think there's an incompatibility with those numbers. You're not wrong. I make it very easy to sign up and try Magic Sales Bot so that I can get feedback on what works and what doesn't from my users.

I'm constantly running experiments based on user feedback. Right now, I'm testing out [if users even care about GPT-3](https://twitter.com/Ryan___Doyle/status/1430520055255769091]). With my daily 5-10 signups, I'm looking for signal that users are getting value out of the product. Those signals come in the shape of burning up their free trial credits and upgrading to a pro plan. Once I see that signal, I'll know I'm that much closer to product/market fit.

But there's a downside to changing the product every week. It never truly gets "finished," and users end up putting up with rough edges that a more focused direction would polish off. Even still, product focus is everything for me right now. What product can I build that provides so much value that users will use it in spite of rough edges? What product will provide enough value that, when I start pouring on more marketing, won't cause users to sign up and churn a month later?

That's still a daily operation to find. I've had a lot of help from the Twitter community, the Calm Fund community, and my friends to get me to iterate in the right direction. Want to help me iterate? [Give me your feedback on Twitter, then](https://twitter.com/Ryan___Doyle)!

I wonder where Magic Sales Bot will be next year this time?
