This week, I launched my first SaaS (trychatty.com) and crossed 100 conversations with prospective Chatty customers. 5 of those put credit cards down to take the free trial. But this isn't the idea I made money from this week.

I've been doing Free Sales Advice Friday for months in communities like Visualize Value. Being a professional salesperson, it's pretty straightforward. Someone drops the name of their business, I take 10 minutes to write a scrappy plan for how I'd sell their product. They find it very helpful:

It's roughly the same every time. Someone has an idea, builds it, but doesn't know how to find customers. I share how I'd find their people and what I'd say to them. At the same time, so many people have been asking me how I hustled to get beta users for Chatty. I started to ask if I should build something to help bootstrappers win at sales. The response:

So I wrote a report: [1 Tip, 1 Tool, and 1 Teardown.](https://www.notion.so/1-tip-1-tool-1-teardown-67985c502d064139940ee12c28912c5d) I sent it out to the people I've been doing Free Sales Advice Friday for. I told them I was testing the waters on a premium newsletter to help Bootstrappers win at Sales. This was focused on generating sales from your first 100 targets. The response:

**2 presale subscriptions in the first day. More money than I've made from Chatty so far. Profitable before I even started.**

I've talked to 31 people so far, and I'm going to talk to 100. I'm giving myself until next Monday to presell 10 spots to get this idea of the ground. I definitely feel like I'm hitting a zeitgeist here: **People are tired of the 12 startups in 12 months concept.** It leads to un-used, un-validated ideas. Lost time and products nobody wants. And the worst thing of all: **otherwise well-meaning boostrappers losing money and confidence in themselves**.

So I'd like to introduce a concept. **The Rule of 100**. 1 idea, as long as it takes you to speak to 100 prospects. If you can pre-sell at least 10 people on your concept, **build the damn thing**. Do this before you go building things. Let's build from a place of strength, with users who have skin in the game.

I'm eating my own dogfood here by preselling this newsletter, where I'll also be expanding on this process. I also realize this invalidates Chatty (at most, 5 paid users from 100 conversations). And I'm ok with that. I'll let it run in the background for a while to see if anything else happens, but I'd rather work on the idea people are offering me money for.

**I'm filling a few more spots for my newsletter on sales for bootstrappers. If you're interested in helping me get it off the ground, email me at rpdoyle1@gmail.com.**
