After weeks of growth and exciting stuff, I feel like I'm slogging along right now.

I'm at the same number of customers as last week, but I lost some MRR. I had a side project to Magic Sales Bot with 1 customer paying several hundred dollars per month. GPT denied my use case so I shut it down and therefore lost the customer.

At the same time, the sales emails MSB are generating just plain... suck. It was doing well for a while, but I can't seem to get it to write like a human and write personalized emails. It's one or the other, and it's disheartening and frustrating.

I just want this product to work. I want people to use it and find it useful. I want to help them make so much money they're ecstatic to tell their friends. The current reality is that the majority of users try 1 - 3 times and then don't log back in.

Why?
 - It's slow
 - The results suck
 - The UX likely isn't great
 - I'm missing something obvious that I just don't know about.

 This isn't going to fail. I'm going to make this happen. I don't know how, but I know it to be true.
