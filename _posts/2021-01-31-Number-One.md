Well, [Magic Sales Bot](magicsalesbot.com) smashed the 10 customer mark when I hit [#1 on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/magic-sales-bot) this Tuesday.

It was a wild experience. What's more wild to me is the amount of customers that came in. I raised my prices. I even sold 2 annual deals.

There's a lot of work to do from here. Namely, upping the product experience to really wow my users. Also, the customer acquisition path changes. My goal is to focus on long term SEO via blogging. I'll still be emailing users, both free and paid, but I took a crack at blogging by writing up this whole experience [here](https://magicsalesbot.com/blog/getting-access-to-gpt-3-finding-my-first-10-customers).
