The MRR for [salesadvice.io](salesadvice.io) is up to $198 MRR this week.

I've been heads down for the last ten days on [MagicSalesbot.com](MagicSalesbot.com). Using GPT-3 to write sales emails.

It's incredibly promising. I'm waiting on OpenAI to approve my use case. I'm not waiting around to get customers, though.

These next two weeks I'm setting up calls to do personalized demos to my beta subscribers. I'm asking them to put their card down for a Dec 15 start date. In return, they get it for $39/m. I intend on taking it to $99/m ASAP.

That's all for this week. I tasted blood and am in hustle mode. Oh, and [Value.app](https://www.value.app/feed/permissionless-apprenticeship-ryan-doyle) wrote about me this week.
