This last week was all about refining [Magic Sales Bot](magicsalesbot.com) in public.

I planned a Product Hunt launch for this upcoming Tuesday, alongside launches on Reddit, different slack groups, etc.

To this point, building in public has netted a lot of beta subscribers in the indiehackers + dev community. I've been building this for professional salespeople and only have a few using it so far.

So the goals of this week are to launch Magic Sales Bot more broadly, and use that to target more professional sales people. It's taking a lot longer than I expected to get to my goal of ten customers. It's also taking a lot longer to get to my goal of a perfect email generation tool.

Little by little, moving forward.
